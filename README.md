## Arrays in C
**Definition:**

An array is a data structure that stores multiple pieces of the same data in contiguous memory locations.

**Beginner's Definition:**

An array is like a box with slots. Each slot holds a value of the same datatype, such as a character or an integer. All the slots are lined up in a row, and each one has a number, called an index, to help you find it easily. You can declare the size of the box when you create it and assign values to each slot using these indices.

**Practice Assignment:**

Write a C program that performs the following tasks with a one-dimensional array:

- Declare an array of integers with a size of 5.
- Input 5 integer values from the user and store them in the array.
- Display the array.
- Find and print the largest and smallest element in the array.
